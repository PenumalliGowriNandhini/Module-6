# Exp.No:27
## Operator Overloading
# AIM
To write a Python program to overload the division operator (/) in a user-defined complex class to perform division between two complex number objects and display the result.

# ALGORITHM
1.Start the program.
2.Define a class complex to represent complex numbers.
3.Create a constructor __init__() to initialize the real part a and imaginary part b.
4.Overload the division operator __truediv__() to divide the corresponding real and imaginary parts of two complex numbers.
5.Overload the __str__() method to return the complex number in a readable format.
6.Create two objects Ob1 and Ob2 of the complex class with initial values.
7.Divide Ob1 by Ob2 using the overloaded division operator and store the result in Ob3.
8.Print the result Ob3.
9.End the program.

class complex:
    def __init__(self, a, b):
        self.a = a
        self.b = b

    def __truediv__(self, other):
        real=self.a/other.a
        imag=self.b/other.b
        return complex(real, imag)
    def __str__(self):
        return f"({self.a}, {self.b})"
Ob1 = complex(10, 21)
Ob2 = complex(2, 3)
Ob3 = Ob1 / Ob2
print(Ob3)

# RESULT
Thus, the program to overload the division operator for complex numbers was executed successfully and the output was verified.
